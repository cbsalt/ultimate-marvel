Environment variables
Create a file .env using .env.example and add your marvel apikeys. To understand how to, access https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started
Server-side applications must pass two parameters in addition to the apikey parameter:

For example, a user with a public key of "1234" and a private key of "abcd" could construct a valid call as follows:

http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/comics?ts=1&apikey=1234&hash=ffd275c5130566a2916217b101f26150
